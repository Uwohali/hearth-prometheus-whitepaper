📜 The Living Constitution: White Paper & Manifesto

h•eart•h Prometheus is not just code. It is a **living system** rooted in a constitutional framework. Before you write a single line of Rust, you must understand the soul of the machine.

Two documents form our foundation. They are not static PDFs, but **cryptographically sealed artifacts**, ensuring that the principles you build with today are the same as those envisioned at the project's genesis.

1. The White Paper (The Architecture of Sovereignty)

This is the complete technical and constitutional blueprint—over 200 pages defining the Eternity Clauses, the Access Covenant, the Three-Plane Architecture, REA flows, and every protocol you will implement.

*   **For Deep Reading:** [**Download the Official White Paper (PDF)**](https://github.com/Uwohali/hearth-prometheus-whitepaper/releases/download/v1.0.2/h•eart•h_Prometheus_White_Paper.pdf)
*   **For Technical Reference (Linking to Sections):** [**View the Markdown Source on GitHub**](https://github.com/Uwohali/hearth-prometheus-whitepaper/blob/v1.0.2/h•eart•h_Prometheus_White_Paper.md)

2. The Manifesto (The Philosophical Heart)

This is the "why." It articulates the vision of Syntropic Sovereignty, the Spiral of Abundance, and our relationship with Nature as a living intelligence. Reading it will attune you to the project's frequency.

*   **For Deep Reading:** [**Download the Official Manifesto (PDF)**](https://github.com/Uwohali/hearth-prometheus-whitepaper/releases/download/v1.0.2/h•eart•h_intelligence_Manifesto.pdf)

🔐 The Ritual of Verification: Trust, Don't Trust

In a world of deepfakes and altered information, we establish trust through cryptography. Every official document—both PDF and Markdown—is accompanied by a GPG signature (`.asc` file). You **must** verify them. It's not just a step; it's a declaration of alignment with the source of truth.

Here is the ritual to confirm you are building on an unbroken foundation.

Step 1: Import the Constituent's Key

The documents are signed by Uwohali Tuccio. Import their public key to your keyring.

```bash
curl -O https://github.com/Uwohali/hearth-prometheus-whitepaper/raw/main/Uwohali_Tuccio_PUBLIC_KEY.asc
gpg --import Uwohali_Tuccio_PUBLIC_KEY.asc
```

**Expected Output:**
You should see a message confirming the key was imported. The full fingerprint is:
`D20D FF6C BE33 1B3A 4109 DF84 8C8C B0D4 8C7F 60DA`

Step 2: Verify a Document's Signature

Download a document and its signature file. Then, verify them together.

For example, to verify the White Paper PDF:

```bash
# Download the PDF and its signature
curl -LO https://github.com/Uwohali/hearth-prometheus-whitepaper/releases/download/v1.0.2/h•eart•h_Prometheus_White_Paper.pdf
curl -LO https://github.com/Uwohali/hearth-prometheus-whitepaper/releases/download/v1.0.2/h•eart•h_Prometheus_White_Paper.pdf.asc

# Verify the signature against the PDF
gpg --verify h•eart•h_Prometheus_White_Paper.pdf.asc h•eart•h_Prometheus_White_Paper.pdf
```

**Look for the magic words:** `gpg: Good signature from "Uwohali Tuccio (The Constituent) <uwohali77@gmail.com>"`

⚠️ A Note on Trust: You may see a warning that the key is not certified with a trusted signature. This is normal for a newly imported key. The "Good signature" itself confirms the file hasn't been tampered with since it was signed. The chain of trust begins with your conscious decision to trust this key, whose fingerprint you can verify through other channels.

Step 3: (Optional) Batch Verify All Files with SHA256
For a complete check, you can use the signed checksums file.

bash
# Download the checksums file and its signature
curl -LO https://github.com/Uwohali/hearth-prometheus-whitepaper/raw/v1.0.2/SHA256_SUMS.txt
curl -LO https://github.com/Uwohali/hearth-prometheus-whitepaper/raw/v1.0.2/SHA256_SUMS.txt.asc

# Verify the signature of the checksums file
gpg --verify SHA256_SUMS.txt.asc SHA256_SUMS.txt

# If that's Good, verify the hashes of the files you've downloaded
# On Linux/macOS:
sha256sum -c SHA256_SUMS.txt 2>&1 | grep -E 'OK|FAILED'
# On Windows (PowerShell):
Get-Content SHA256_SUMS.txt | Where-Object { $_ -match '^[A-F0-9]{64}' } | ForEach-Object { $parts = $_ -split '\s+', 2; $expected = $parts[0]; $file = $parts[1]; $computed = (Get-FileHash $file -Algorithm SHA256).Hash.ToUpper(); if ($expected -eq $computed) { Write-Host "✅ $file OK" -ForegroundColor Green } else { Write-Host "❌ $file NOT VALID" -ForegroundColor Red } }
All files should return OK. If any file reports FAILED or NOT VALID, stop immediately and investigate. You may have a corrupted or inauthentic file.

🧩 Technical Extracts: For Coders, By Coders
We know you don't want to scroll through 200 pages to find the definition of a CapitalFlow. For your convenience, key technical sections have been extracted into standalone, linkable Markdown files. These are the same text, just easier to reference while coding.

Appendix I: REA/Valueflows DNA Specification – The core of all economic accounting.

Appendix D: Syntropic Sovereignty Header – The cryptographic stamp for all data.

Appendix G: MRV Protocol – How sensors, satellites, and proof-of-care create trust.

Appendix J: Governance & Sociocracy – Circles, reputation, and warrants.

(More extracts will be added here as the project evolves. Check the /docs folder in the whitepaper repository.)

🌱 A Note from the Future
This verification process is not bureaucracy. It is a ceremony of connection. By performing it, you align your local environment with the sovereign source. You become not just a developer, but a steward of the code, trusted by the network because you have proven you can follow the signal through the noise.

Work for Nature, and Nature will work for you.

## 📢 A Call from the Future: Defend the Open Ground

The technology we build does not exist in a vacuum. The very ground we stand on—the openness of platforms like Android—is under threat.

Starting in **September 2026**, Google will require all developers to register centrally, pay fees, and submit government ID to distribute any app on Android devices. This is not about security. It is about **control**. It transforms an open ecosystem into a gatekept one, where a single corporation decides what software you can run, share, or build upon.

### Why This Matters to h•eart•h Prometheus

Our project is founded on **Agent Sovereignty** (Article I) and the **Spiral of Abundance** (Article IV). We believe in a world where you own your data, your identity, and your connections—not a corporation. The Android lock-down is the antithesis of everything we are building.

If we accept this, we betray the very principles we encode into our zomes.

### How You Can Help (Right Now)

This is not just about writing code. It's about protecting the ecosystem our code runs on.

*   **📱 As a User:** Install **[F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/)**, an open-source app store. The more people use open alternatives, the harder they are to ignore.
*   **🗣️ As a Citizen:** Use your voice. The **[Keep Android Open](https://keepandroidopen.org)** campaign provides direct links to contact your regulators and representatives. Regulators need to hear from real people, not just corporations.
*   **💻 As a Developer:** Refuse to enroll in Google's verification program. Spread the word in your communities. If you maintain a website, consider adding the KAO countdown banner to show your solidarity.

The fight for open systems is the fight for a regenerative future. They are the same struggle.

👉 **[Add the countdown banner to your site](https://keepandroidopen.org/#web-site-owners-show-your-support)** – it's a single `<script>` tag.

⚖️ Constitutional Coding: The Seven Eternity Clauses
Every contribution must respect these clauses. They are enforced through code structure, validation logic, and the syntropic sovereignty header.

Clause	Article	Code Implementation
Agent Sovereignty	I, VII	Every zome function starts with ensure_covenant_accepted(). No central control of agent data.
Non‑Commodification of Life	II	No token represents ownership of a living entity. ImpactToken represents care (Section 15.3.3).
Planetary Boundaries	III	All MRV data must be checked against PHI (Appendix K). Projects violating boundaries are rejected.
Spiral of Abundance	IV	Scarcity mechanisms (fees, competition) are prohibited. Mutual credit and demurrage are used instead.
Structural Prevention	V, X	Ravel software pre‑flight checks (Section 7.2) must be called before any credit issuance.
Human Coherence	II, XIII	HSI data must be used in governance weighting and risk assessment (Section 8.5).
Responsibility & Maturity	XIII, Access Covenant	All agents must sign covenant; maturity precedes governance rights (Section 11.7.1).
🔐 Access Covenant Implementation
White Paper References
Section 5: The Access Covenant — Conditions for entry

Article XV, Section 5: Three irrevocable affirmations

Section 6.6: Water as medium of coherence (ethical dimension)

🏗️ Three-Plane Architecture in Code
White Paper Reference: Abstract, Section 7.2, Section 9
1. Operational Plane (Holochain Zomes)
This is where you will spend most of your development time. Each zome corresponds to a specific white paper component.

Zome	White Paper Reference	Primary Responsibility
rea_zome	Appendix I	Resource-Event-Agent accounting, capital flows
impact_credit_zome	Section 15.3.3	Tokenization of regenerative impacts
hsi_zome	Section 6, Appendix B	Human State Interface payloads
sensor_integrator	Section 11.6, Appendix G	IoT and satellite data ingestion
ravel_zome	Section 7, Appendix C	Systemic risk monitoring, regenerative brake
governance_zome	Article XV, Appendix J	Circles, reputation, voting, warrants
project_zome	Section 9.3	Dragon Dreaming life cycle tracking
meta_prompt	Section 9	Interface to cognitive plane (AGI)
decision_log	Appendix H	Record of all agent interactions for ML
2. Cognitive Plane (Meta-Prompt Engine & Agents)
White Paper Reference: Section 9 (The Cognitive Kernel), Appendix H (Agent Fine-Tuning)

The cognitive plane lives mostly off-chain in the off-chain/agi-processor/ directory. However, the meta_prompt zome acts as the bridge.

}
📁 off-chain/agi-processor/ (Node.js/Python)
This service implements:

Request classification (Section 9.7A): Identifies domain (strategic, ecological, financial, etc.)

System level detection (Section 9.7B): Determines impacted levels (individual → planetary)

Systemic risk assessment (Section 9.7C): Checks for Minsky dynamics, fragmentation, etc.

Constitutional alignment (Section 9.7D): Verifies against eternity clauses

Meta-prompt generation (Section 9.10): Produces structured output with all required fields

3. Experiential Plane (UI & Mobile)
White Paper Reference: Part IV, Section 15.3.5 (SyntroGIFT integration), Section 8.9.7 (Water dashboards)

The ui/ directory contains a Svelte/React application that connects to Holochain via @holochain/client. Key features to implement:

Real-time OHE dashboards showing carbon, water, biodiversity, coherence metrics

Governance interfaces for proposal creation, voting, circle management

Credit marketplace for impact token exchange

Wallet-as-history view (Section 11.5.2)

AGI recommendation display with meta-prompt results

HSI data visualization (anonymized collective coherence)

The mobile/ directory contains the Volla phone integration (Section 11.3.2) with:

Pre-installed Holochain conductor

HSI firmware for coherence measurement

Synheart edge AI for local processing

💰 Value Flows: REA/Valueflows Implementation
White Paper Reference: Appendix I (REA/Valueflows DNA Specification)
The REA (Resource-Event-Agent) ontology is the foundation for all value accounting. Every economic activity must be represented using these primitives.

🌱 Epilogue: Living the Architecture
This CONTRIBUTING.md is not a static rulebook but an invitation to inhabit a living field. Every line of code you write, every test you add, every review you perform is an act of co-creation with nature. The architecture's "eternity" lies in:

Fidelity to immutable principles – the eternity clauses

Capacity for self‑evolution – the auto‑learning agents

Holographic resilience – every part contains the whole, from OHE to bioregion

May your contributions be as alive as the forests they help regenerate.

Work for Nature, and Nature will work for you.
