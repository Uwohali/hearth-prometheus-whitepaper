# Prometheus v1.1 — Canon Staging Audit

## Audit status

The Prometheus v1.1 canon staging repository has passed the local staging audit.

This repository is being prepared as the clean canonical staging repository for the Prometheus v1.1 Genesis Institutional Canonical Line.

It is not yet the final signed canonical release.

## Repository path

Local staging path:

GENESIS_REINSTALL_V1_1/repos/prometheus-canon

Future GitHub repository:

Permaculture-DAO/prometheus-canon

## Source package

Initial files were imported from:

PROMETHEUS_V1_1_CANONICAL_RUNTIME_SYNC_PACK_RC2_STRICT_2026_05_29

The source package passed:

- format checks;
- canonical alignment checks;
- Markdown table completeness checks;
- release verification checks.

The reported RC2 verification result was:

- format checks passed;
- canonical alignment checks passed;
- markdown table completeness checks passed: 150/150;
- release verification passed.

## Imported file count

The staging repository currently contains 31 files.

## Forbidden file audit

The staging repository contains no premature:

- `.sha256` files;
- `.asc` detached signature files.

This confirms that RC2 package hashes and signatures were not blindly imported into the clean Genesis canonical repository.

## Format audit

Text files were checked for:

- UTF-8 compatibility;
- Unix LF line endings;
- absence of CRLF line endings.

Result:

- UTF-8 check passed;
- CRLF check passed;
- no malformed text files detected.

## Canonical White Paper files

The staged canonical White Paper files are:

- canonical/h-earth-prometheus-white-paper.docx
- canonical/h-earth-prometheus-white-paper.md
- canonical/h-earth-prometheus-white-paper.source.md

The DOCX file remains the source-of-truth document supplied for the v1.1 alignment process.

The Markdown files represent the extracted canonical Markdown line for repository use and review.

## Staging checksum register

The local staging checksum register is:

PROMETHEUS_CANON_STAGING_CHECKSUMS.txt

SHA-256 of the checksum register:

RC2 package hash reviewed as historical release-candidate evidence; not reproduced here as an active canonical checksum. Active staging hashes are maintained in the applicable root-level staging checksum register.

This checksum register is a local staging integrity reference only.

It is not the final canonical SHA256_SUMS.txt.

## Signing boundary

No final canonical checksum has been generated yet.

No GPG signature has been generated yet.

Final checksums and detached GPG signatures must be generated only after:

1. final text review;
2. Markdown completeness confirmation;
3. repository-wide Markdown alignment;
4. explicit update or deprecation of stale documents;
5. textual freeze;
6. checksum regeneration;
7. local GPG signing with the authorized release key;
8. release manifest update;
9. GitHub release publication.

## Audit conclusion

The Prometheus v1.1 canon staging repository is clean enough to proceed to first local Git initialization.

The repository is ready for:

1. local Git initialization;
2. first staging commit;
3. creation of the remote GitHub repository Permaculture-DAO/prometheus-canon;
4. push to main;
5. subsequent QA before textual freeze.

It is not yet ready for final canonical release signing.
