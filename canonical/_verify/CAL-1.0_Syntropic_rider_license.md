With syntropic governance rider
For h•eart•h intelligence & Prometheus sovereign syntropy system

# Preamble: Licensed sovereignty

This software, the Prometheus Sovereign Syntropy System, is sovereign code. Its purpose is to enact and enforce a regenerative future as defined by its governing framework. Access is a privilege bound to this purpose. To operate this code is to enter into a pact with the future it is designed to create.

# Section 1: CAL-1.0 core license

This software is licensed under the Cryptographic Autonomy License v1.0 (CAL-1.0). This license grants you the conditional right to use, study, modify, and distribute the software, with the fundamental requirement that you preserve the autonomy of end-users by providing them with the cryptographic keys and data necessary to control their own digital existence.

---

# Section 2: Syntropic rider (binding condition of use)

Your license under CAL-1.0 is expressly conditioned on your adherence to this syntropic rider. These are not suggestions but binding operational and physical constraints.

## 2.1 Alignment with the sovereign syntropy framework

Any use, modification, or distribution of this software is subject to the supreme governance of the h•eart•h Prometheus Sovereign Syntropy White Paper (February 26, 2026). You must actively implement the principles of Syntropic Sovereignty, Value Supremacy, and the Spiral of Abundance as the primary operational logic.

## 2.2 Mandate of the spiral of Abundance

Use must generate regenerative value: outcomes that measurably increase systemic health, community resilience, and the capacity to care for living beings. Efficiency or profit that degrades these capacities constitutes a material breach and an ultra vires act.

## 2.3 Absolute limits & anti-extraction

The following uses are categorically prohibited:

- **Ecological harm**: Contributing to the transgression of Planetary Boundaries or the degradation of functional biodiversity.
- **Extractive models**: Creating artificial scarcity, implementing predatory debt, or any economic model based on zero-sum logic.
- **Centralization & harm**: Centralizing decision-making power or manipulating human behavior to erode individual judgment and responsibility.
- **Data & IP extraction**: Using this code or its outputs to train external AI models without the explicit, written, and revocable consent of both Permaculture DAO LLC and the affected data sovereigns (Constituents).

## 2.4 Sovereignty by Code

You agree that the Syntropic Sovereignty Header is an integral, non-removable part of the software. Tampering with or removing this header to bypass constitutional constraints triggers the Self-Executing Injunction defined in Article 5 of the Syntropic Sovereignty Header, resulting in immediate termination of all rights.
